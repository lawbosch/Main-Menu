This repository contains some **classic Flash games** in `.swf` format, allowing you to play them **offline or in modern browsers** using Ruffle.

## üïπÔ∏è **What Are Flash Games?**  
Flash games were **browser-based games** created using Adobe Flash, popular from the early 2000s until Flash was officially **discontinued in 2020**.

Although modern browsers no longer support Flash, you can still play `.swf` files using **Ruffle**, an open-source Flash emulator.

### **Method 1: Ruffle (Flash Player Emulator)**  

1. Download the **Ruffle Desktop App** from [https://ruffle.rs/](https://ruffle.rs/). **(I also have the setup.msi file available in the diretory)**
2. Open Ruffle and **drag & drop** the `.swf` file into the player.

### **Method 2: Flashpoint (Full Flash Game Archive)**
[Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/) is a **massive Flash game preservation project** with thousands of archived `.swf` games.  

üîó **Download Flashpoint** to access **an entire library of Flash games** without needing to find individual `.swf` files.

## ‚ö† **Important Notes**  
- Ruffle **does not support all Flash games yet**, especially those using **ActionScript 3**.  
- Some `.swf` files **may not work** or may have glitches.  
- **For best compatibility**, check the Ruffle [support list](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/wiki/Compatibility).  

üéÆ **Enjoy playing classic Flash games on modern systems!**
